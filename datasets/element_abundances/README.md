# Element Abundance Datasets

Curated scientific assets for compositional reasoning, screening, and
prototype ranking.

The canonical dataset is:

```text
earth-abundance.yaml
```

Values are stored as:

```yaml
Element: abundance
```

where abundance is reported in:

```text
mg/kg
```

## Repository Role

This dataset supports:

* composition screening
* abundance-aware ranking
* structure-prototype prioritization
* materials discovery workflows
* future composition-based heuristics

Tools should read abundance information from this dataset rather than
maintaining independent abundance tables.

Current downstream users include:

* `tools/structure_prototypes/abundance_rank.py`
* abundance-aware structure prototype ranking workflows

## Dataset Structure

Example:

```yaml
O: 461000
Si: 282000
Al: 82300
Fe: 56300
```

## Source and Attribution

The crustal-abundance values in `earth-abundance.yaml` were transcribed from:

> Haynes, W. M. (Ed.). *CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics*. CRC Press, 2016.

The numerical values are represented here in a machine-readable YAML format
for use in bmd-store. The original CRC text, tables, formatting, and other
copyrighted material are not reproduced.

The YAML representation and associated bmd-store software are distributed under
the bmd-store repository license. The underlying scientific data remain attributed
to the source above.

The original spreadsheet used in earlier BMD workflows has been replaced by
this canonical YAML representation for improved readability, version control,
and interoperability.

## Validation

The current YAML file should parse cleanly, use valid element symbols, and store
numeric abundance values. Treat edits as data changes: check parsing and inspect
any changed element values before using them in screening workflows.

## Limitations

* Values represent crustal abundance and are not universal abundance measures.
* Different scientific applications may require alternative abundance datasets,
  such as solar, cosmic, seawater, or bulk-Earth abundances.
* Screening results should not be interpreted as estimates of material cost,
  availability, or manufacturability.
