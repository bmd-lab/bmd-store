# bmd-store Agent Instructions

bmd-store is the public curated scientific-data, evidence, and supporting-tools
repository of the Burton Materials Discovery Lab.

bmd-store's canonical ecosystem role is BMD-curated supporting scientific data,
reference evidence, and non-core scientific tools outside the bmd-compute VASP
data-generation pipeline.

If a capability determines how BMD generates a VASP calculation, its
authoritative implementation belongs in bmd-compute. If it provides supporting
scientific data or tooling but is not part of the core VASP data-generation
pipeline, it belongs in bmd-store. bmd-check consumes exposed capabilities and
evidence to inspect, diagnose, explain, and advise without duplicating their
authority.

bmd-store complements the public `bmd-help` repository:
- `bmd-help` focuses on public educational knowledge, onboarding material, and
  conceptual guidance
- bmd-store focuses on curated scientific reference data, publicly shareable
  infrastructure notes, and lab-controlled computational assets

Intended access model:
- public `bmd-help` material introduces concepts and basic workflows
- the public GitHub repository or website is the first curated bmd-store entry point
- cluster execution uses a normal git checkout or pull of bmd-store on the cluster
- Codex is used from a laptop or workstation checkout for curation, review, and extension

Do not assume Codex is installed on the cluster. Cluster-facing tools should be
directly runnable or copyable from a cluster-side bmd-store checkout.

Student audience assumption:
- most students are materials scientists, not software engineers
- many have little or no initial experience with Git, Codex, metadata, schemas,
  or package design
- they are primarily learning Python, VASP, pymatgen, SLURM, and computational materials science
- student-facing workflows should expose concrete research actions before repository mechanics
- metadata and ontology should support maintainers underneath, not dominate the first user experience

Primary focus areas:
- VASP-based density functional theory (DFT)
- atomic structure workflows and structure manipulation
- chemical formula and composition screening
- reproducible computational materials science
- HPC workflow support and operational standardization
- publicly shareable infrastructure documentation
- reusable computational assets

## Repository Philosophy

bmd-store is intended to function as:
- a publicly shareable operational reference for externally managed HPC systems
- a curated home for lab-controlled computational assets
- and a long-term operational memory system for the research group

## Research-Group Information Model

Burton Materials Discovery Lab computational information has three broad classes:
- knowledge: public-facing concepts, explanations, tutorials, and onboarding
  material. This should primarily live in the public `bmd-help` repository and
  group tutorial pages.
- infrastructure: publicly shareable operational information about university-managed
  systems such as SLURM, cluster accounts, modules, partitions, filesystems, and
  VASP execution environments. bmd-store may document current practice, but the BMD
  Lab does not control the underlying infrastructure.
- assets: lab-controlled tools, codes, scripts, datasets, templates,
  examples, reference evidence, non-core workflow aids, and supporting
  standards. These are the parts bmd-store owns, adapts, and maintains.

Do not blur these boundaries. Move broadly teachable material toward public
tutorials, record infrastructure assumptions with explicit limitations, and keep
assets practical, runnable, and easy for students to adapt.

Priorities:
1. scientific correctness
2. reproducibility
3. maintainability
4. supporting workflow evidence and reuse
5. onboarding efficiency
6. institutional knowledge preservation

## Organizational Principles

Prefer:
- reusable primitives over workflow duplication
- concise README provenance and structured data over duplicated prose
- validated reference examples over undocumented experimentation
- maintainable assets and infrastructure notes over excessive abstraction

Distinguish clearly between:
- reusable tools and primitives
- higher-level supporting scientific workflows
- validated operational examples
- lower-maturity but curated content documented with clear limitations

## Metadata Guidance

Metadata should support maintainers underneath the user experience. Do not make
metadata, schemas, or repository mechanics the first thing students encounter.

Do not add bmd-store metadata sidecars such as `bmdex.yaml` or
`*.bmdex.yaml` unless explicitly asked. Preserve useful curation information in
the place students and maintainers will naturally read:
- human-facing provenance, validation state, limitations, and usage notes belong
  in the nearest relevant `README.md`
- agent-facing repository policy, information-model guidance, and curation
  conventions belong in `AGENTS.md`
- scientific YAML files are acceptable when the YAML is the dataset itself, such
  as element abundance or element-charge tables

Do not recreate top-level `metadata/`, `methods/`, `hpc/`, `examples/`,
`templates/`, `TOOLS.md`, or `repository*` governance
structures unless explicitly asked. Human-facing repository guidance belongs in
`README.md`; agent-facing guidance belongs in `AGENTS.md`.

## Contribution Guidance

When integrating contributions:
- preserve validated reference evidence
- document assumptions explicitly
- identify conflicting conventions
- avoid undocumented workflow changes
- favor interoperability and maintainability
- preserve scientific provenance where applicable

## Git Workflow

- Always create new feature branches from current `main`.
- Feature branches are temporary.
- After a feature branch is merged, delete it locally and remotely.
- Assume bmd-store normally has only `main` and at most one active feature branch.

## Repository Boundaries

bmd-store should prioritize:
- reusable tools
- reference evidence for validated workflows
- templates
- publicly shareable operational guidance for externally managed infrastructure
- troubleshooting knowledge
- supporting computational standards outside the core bmd-compute VASP generation pipeline
- curated scientific datasets

bmd-store should avoid becoming:
- a dump of active project files
- a collection of temporary notebooks
- a storage location for large calculation outputs
- a purely pedagogical tutorial repository

## Public Repository Safety

bmd-store content must be appropriate for public access. Do not commit credentials,
deployment secrets, private keys, personal records, unpublished research or
collaborator material without publication approval, proprietary datasets
without redistribution permission, or licensed VASP `POTCAR`/PAW potential
contents. Use repository-safe `POTCAR.spec` files for potential names.

If a credential is committed, report it immediately for revocation and exposure
handling; deleting it in a later commit is not sufficient.

## Newcomer Guidance

Newcomer-facing workflows should:
- minimize implicit knowledge
- contain executable examples
- prioritize clarity over abstraction
- distinguish validated workflows from lower-maturity workflows
- avoid requiring Git, Codex, or metadata knowledge for ordinary tool usage
