# Electroneutrality Matching Tools

Runnable utilities for generating chemically charge-balanced candidate
compositions from oxidation-state assignments.

Canonical dataset:
- `datasets/element_charges/`

Provenance:
- `ORIGIN.md`

Dependencies:
- Python
- PyYAML

Status:
- experimental practical utilities
- validated by example runs, not a complete scientific workflow

## Scope

The tool logic matches combinations of positive and negative oxidation states
whose weighted sum is zero. Typical uses include composition generation,
candidate formula screening, and oxidation-state constrained enumeration.

Electroneutrality is a necessary but insufficient condition for chemical
realizability. Generated formulas still require structural, thermodynamic, and
electronic validation where relevant.

These scripts preserve the core practical workflow from the Burton Materials Discovery Lab
`electroneutral_match` work without turning it into a larger software framework.

## Layout

- `generate_binary_oxides.py`: generate electroneutral binary oxide formulas.
- `generate_ternaries.py`: generate electroneutral ternary oxide formulas.
- `_datasets.py`: load the canonical oxidation-state dataset.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python3 tools/composition/electroneutrality/generate_binary_oxides.py
python3 tools/composition/electroneutrality/generate_ternaries.py
```
