# Domain Context Tools

This directory contains read-only producers for curated bmd-store contextual
reference knowledge.

The current producer queries local bmd-store JSON records and writes JSON-safe
contextual reference evidence:

```bash
printf '{"query":{"code":"VASP","calculation_family":"hybrid_functional","functional":"HSE06","electronic_algorithm":"Damped","topic":"electronic_iteration_behavior"}}' | python -B -m tools.domain_context.query
```

## Record Contract

Records live in `vasp/contextual_reference/records/`. Every record is validated
before any query is answered, and one invalid record makes the query return a
structured `record_validation_error` or `record_store_error` instead of
results. A record must have:

- `schema_version` equal to a supported record schema version (currently `1`);
- an `id` identical to its filename without `.json`, unique across records
  (case-insensitively);
- `status` of `active`, `deprecated`, or `retired`; queries return only
  `active` records;
- non-empty string `id`, `title`, `status`, `contextual_statement`, and
  `diagnostic_relevance`;
- non-empty lists of non-empty strings for `topics` and `limitations`;
- at least one source, each with non-empty text fields and an absolute
  `https://` URL;
- `record_provenance.record_version` as a positive integer;
- if present, `applicability.relevant_observed_patterns` as a non-empty list of
  identifiers from the observed-pattern vocabulary (below); and
- no top-level fields other than the required fields and the optional
  `shorthand_correction`.

Records must be strict JSON: `NaN` and `Infinity` are rejected. Increasing
`record_version` when a record's scientific content changes is still a review
responsibility; the producer does not detect unversioned edits.

## Query Fields

`code` and its alias `domain` take one string and must not disagree.
`calculation_family`, `functional`, `electronic_algorithm`, `topic`, and
`observed_patterns` take a string or a list of strings. `input_tags` takes an
object mapping VASP tag names to scalar values, for example
`{"LHFCALC": ".TRUE."}`. `null` and empty lists mean "not specified". Other
malformed values return an `invalid_query` error rather than an empty result.

## Observed-Pattern Vocabulary

bmd-store owns the identifiers used for run observations:
`vasp/contextual_reference/observed_patterns.json` defines each identifier and
its limitations. Records may list only these identifiers in
`applicability.relevant_observed_patterns`, and queries may send only these
identifiers as `observed_patterns`. Identifiers are compared exactly. An
unknown identifier in a query returns `invalid_query`; in a record it is a
`record_validation_error`. A malformed vocabulary file is a
`record_store_error`.

A consumer reports an identifier only when its observation meets that
identifier's definition. The identifiers name observations; they are not
diagnoses.

## Matching

A record matches when the query's `code` agrees and at least one of
`calculation_family`, `functional`, `topic`, `observed_patterns`, or
`input_tags` overlaps the record. Observed patterns are additional evidence,
not a requirement: a record can match on calculation and input fields alone.
Each match reports `matched_fields` and `matched_observed_patterns`, the
record's patterns that the query supplied. An empty
`matched_observed_patterns` means run observations did not contribute to that
match, so consumers must not describe the match as supported by trajectory
evidence.

bmd-store provides reference context. bmd-check performs evidence synthesis and
diagnosis. bmd-compute owns executable calculation methodology for the core
VASP data-generation pipeline.
