# Literature Search

A simple bmd-store tool for estimating how extensively candidate chemical
compositions have appeared in the scientific literature.

The tool reads a list of chemical formulae, searches the Scopus API for each
formula, and writes the number of matching publications to a CSV file.

It is a **researcher-facing screening tool**, not part of the bmd-store
electroneutral-composition generator and not a canonical bmd-store dataset.

## Scope

The literature-search workflow is deliberately narrow:

```text
formula list
    +
Scopus API
    |
    v
publication counts
```

It is useful for rapid screening of large composition spaces. It is not a
novelty detector, a full bibliographic analysis tool, a paper downloader, or a
replacement for a careful literature review.

A low publication count does **not** establish that a material is novel. It only
indicates that the particular Scopus query returned few matching records.

### `scopus_search.py`

Main literature-search script. It:

1. reads chemical formulae from a text file;
2. searches Scopus for each formula;
3. obtains the number of matching records;
4. writes the results to a CSV file;
5. periodically reports the remaining Scopus API quota; and
6. can resume an interrupted search without repeating completed formulae.

### `check_quota.py`

Small utility for checking whether the Scopus API connection is working and
displaying the remaining API quota and reset time.

## Requirements

The search uses the Scopus API through
[`pybliometrics`](https://pybliometrics.readthedocs.io/).

Install it with:

```bash
pip install pybliometrics
```

A valid Elsevier/Scopus API key is required. Scopus credentials should be
configured through pybliometrics, not written into bmd-store scripts or committed to
the repository.

Use the pybliometrics documentation for current setup instructions. API access,
quota, and rate limits are controlled by Elsevier and may change.

## Input

The input is a plain-text file containing one chemical formula per line:

```text
CaTiO3
BaTiO3
Bi2Se3
NaAuSe
CsInS2
```

Formulae may come from an electroneutral composition search, another bmd-store
tool, an external materials database, a manually prepared list, or any other
composition-generation workflow.

This separation is intentional: **literature searching and composition
generation are independent operations.**

## Running A Search

Open `scopus_search.py` and edit the settings near the top of the file:

```python
INPUT_FILE = "formulae.txt"
OUTPUT_FILE = "scopus_counts.csv"

MAX_QUERIES = 20000
SLEEP_TIME = 0.1
```

Then run from the repository root:

```bash
python3 tools/lit_search/scopus_search.py
```

The script processes formulae sequentially and writes each result immediately,
so little progress should be lost if the search is interrupted.

## Checking API Access

Before a large search, check the Scopus API connection and current quota:

```bash
python3 tools/lit_search/check_quota.py
```

## Scopus Query

By default, each formula is searched using:

```text
TITLE-ABS-KEY("FORMULA")
```

For example:

```text
TITLE-ABS-KEY("CaTiO3")
```

This searches article titles, abstracts, and keywords. The quotation marks are
intentional: they request the compact formula as a phrase rather than treating
its components as independent search terms.

## Output

Results are written to a CSV file:

```csv
formula,papers
CaTiO3,12345
BaTiO3,23456
Bi2Se3,34567
NaAuSe,1
```

The first column contains the queried formula and the second contains the number
of Scopus records returned by the search.

## Restarting An Interrupted Search

If the output CSV already exists, `scopus_search.py` reads formulae that have
already completed and skips them. Rows marked `ERROR` are retried on the next
run.

For example, if `formulae.txt` contains 20,000 formulae but
`scopus_counts.csv` already contains results for 8,000 of them, restarting the
script continues with the remaining formulae rather than repeating the first
8,000 queries.

## Interpreting Publication Counts

The returned number should be treated as a **literature-search metric**, not as
a definitive count of papers about a particular crystalline material.

Chemical formula searches have several limitations:

- alternative chemical formula ordering;
- spaces or formatting within formulae;
- subscripts and other typographical representations;
- non-stoichiometric compositions;
- mineral or compound names used instead of formulae;
- formula strings that also occur in unrelated contexts; and
- papers not indexed by Scopus.

Consequently:

```text
papers = 0
```

means:

> No Scopus records were found using this particular query.

It does **not** mean:

> This composition has never been reported.

Likewise, a large count does not necessarily mean every returned paper concerns
the intended material.

## Relationship To Composition Generation

This tool deliberately does not generate electroneutral compositions.

A composition-generation workflow might produce:

```text
electroneutral composition generation
             |
             v
        formulae.txt
             |
             v
      scopus_search.py
             |
             v
     scopus_counts.csv
```

However, `scopus_search.py` only sees `formulae.txt`. It does not need to know
which oxidation states were considered, how charge neutrality was determined,
which elements were allowed, which bmd-store generator produced the formulae, or
whether the formulae were generated by bmd-store at all.

## Formula Ordering

Scopus searches text rather than chemical compositions. Consequently, `NaAuSe`
and an alternative ordering of the same composition are not guaranteed to
produce identical search results.

The literature-search tool does not silently reorder or modify input formulae.
**The formula written in the input file is the formula that is searched.**

If formula normalization or alternative formula representations are required,
generate them explicitly before running the literature search.

## Large Searches

For large candidate spaces:

1. check the API connection and quota first;
2. keep the input formula file unchanged while a search is running;
3. retain the partially completed CSV;
4. allow the restart mechanism to skip completed formulae; and
5. keep the raw search results before performing sorting or filtering.

Keeping raw results separate makes it easier to reproduce or reinterpret a
search later.

## Reproducibility

When publication counts are used in subsequent analysis, retain:

- the original input formula file;
- the raw output CSV;
- the date of the search;
- the query form used;
- the version of `scopus_search.py`; and
- the relevant pybliometrics version.

Literature databases change over time, so repeating the same search at a later
date may produce different counts.
