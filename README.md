# bmd-store

bmd-store is the Burton Materials Discovery Lab repository at Tel Aviv
University for curated supporting scientific data, reference evidence, and
non-core scientific tools used in reproducible computational materials
research.

The repository is public. It contains material that is appropriate to share and
reuse, not private research storage or deployment configuration.

## Where bmd-store Fits

bmd-store complements the public `bmd-help` repository and the other BMD tools:

- `bmd-help` teaches public concepts, onboarding, and basic workflows.
- bmd-store curates scientific datasets, contextual reference knowledge, validated
  evidence, reusable utilities, and publicly shareable infrastructure notes.
- bmd-compute owns methodology and implementation that determine how BMD
  generates VASP calculations.
- bmd-check consumes bmd-store producer interfaces and evidence to inspect,
  diagnose, explain, and advise without duplicating the authority of bmd-store
  or bmd-compute.

bmd-store is designed for graduate students and researchers in materials science.
Useful research actions should stay visible; repository mechanics and metadata
should remain supporting details.

## What Belongs Here

- curated scientific reference data with provenance and limitations;
- machine-readable domain context grounded in a concrete scientific use case;
- validated workflow evidence and reproducible examples;
- reusable non-core scientific tools and transformations;
- publicly shareable HPC operational guidance; and
- templates and supporting standards outside the bmd-compute VASP generation
  pipeline.

The following do not belong in bmd-store:

- runtime calculation state, large generated outputs, or active project dumps;
- credentials, private keys, API tokens, or deployment-local configuration;
- private or unpublished research and collaborator material without explicit
  publication approval;
- personal or student records;
- licensed VASP `POTCAR` or PAW potential contents; and
- proprietary or licensed datasets without redistribution permission.

## Repository Layout

- `datasets/`: curated scientific datasets, including element-charge,
  element-abundance, and structure-prototype data.
- `tools/`: reusable composition, domain-context, structure, and literature
  utilities.
- `vasp/`: VASP supporting assets, examples, contextual references, and
  validation evidence. It does not contain licensed VASP source or potentials.
- `cluster/`: publicly shareable notes and scripts for externally managed HPC
  systems. Local policies and module names may change.
- `tests/`: contract and validation tests for the machine-facing producers and
  records.

## Python Setup

Run commands from the repository root. Python 3.10 or newer is required by the
current producer syntax; Python 3.12 is the routinely verified development
environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmd-lab/bmd-store.git
cd bmd-store
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Windows PowerShell, create and activate the environment with:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` declares the third-party libraries already used by the
researcher-facing scripts. It is intentionally not a lock file. Record exact
package versions when they are material to a scientific result.

The current bmd-check-facing producers and their tests use only the Python standard
library. A contributor working only on those interfaces can run the tests before
installing the scientific stack:

```bash
python -B -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Compile all Python sources as a lightweight syntax check:

```bash
python -B -m compileall -q tools vasp tests
```

Individual tools document runtime inputs, external services, and scientific
limitations in their nearest `README.md`. For example, Materials Project access
requires an API key configured outside the repository, and Scopus tools use the
user's external `pybliometrics` configuration.

## Producer Interfaces

bmd-check consumes fixed JSON stdin/stdout interfaces from a repository
checkout. These commands are also useful for development and debugging. Run
them from the repository root and keep stdout machine-readable.

Composition context:

```bash
printf '{"formula":"MnCu5"}' | python -B -m tools.composition.context_producer
```

VASP domain context:

```bash
printf '{"query":{"code":"VASP","calculation_family":"hybrid_functional","functional":"HSE06","electronic_algorithm":"Damped","topic":"electronic_iteration_behavior"}}' | python -B -m tools.domain_context.query
```

These producers return curated contextual evidence. They do not inspect or
diagnose live calculations, change scientific data, or define bmd-compute
methodology. Their existing schemas, record IDs, versions, and query behavior
are compatibility contracts.

## Researcher Tools

Examples of researcher-facing commands include:

```bash
python tools/structure_transform/generate_all_slabs.py
python tools/structure_transform/make_supercell.py
python tools/composition/electroneutrality/generate_ternaries.py
python tools/structure_prototypes/abundance_rank.py
```

Cluster scripts are intended to run from a normal bmd-store checkout on the cluster;
Codex is not required there. Review each script and the local cluster policy
before submission.

## Curation

Keep provenance, validation status, usage notes, and limitations in the nearest
relevant `README.md`. YAML, JSON, and CSV are appropriate when they are the
scientific data or an established producer record, not as automatic metadata
sidecars.

Do not introduce a broad metadata model, database, ontology, or vector store
without a concrete scientific use case. Keep runtime calculation state,
deployment configuration, and private research storage separate from curated
knowledge and data.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the student contribution workflow and the material
that must never be committed.

## License and Sources

bmd-store repository-owned source code and documentation are available under the
MIT License; see `LICENSE`. Third-party dependencies remain under their own
licenses. Source-derived factual datasets retain the attribution documented
beside each dataset, and the MIT License does not relicense the cited source
publications.

bmd-store does not distribute or license VASP executables, VASP source code,
`POTCAR` files, or PAW potential contents. Repository examples use
`POTCAR.spec` files so users can generate potentials only in an appropriately
licensed environment.
